<p>In this repository we will learn about some basic concepts of JavaScript..</p>
<h3>JavaScript Arrays</h3><p>An Array is a collection of items of same data type stored at contiguous memory allocations. We can access each item by referring to index no. of item. In general index number in array starts from 0. You can see more about arrays in arrays.js file in repository.<br>Syntax:<br/>let array = [item1,item2,item3,item4,.......];</p>
<h3>JavaScript Functions</h3><p>A function is a block of code that performs a specific task, it provides code reusability, and we can divide complex code in small chunks using functions to make code easy to understand for everyone, See Functions.js file in repository to see implementation of functions<h4>Types of Functions</h4>1. Build-In Functions.<br/>2. User Defined Functions<br/>We will see some build in functions in Arrays and other topics, while syntax of user defined functions is given below.<br/>Syntax:<br>function func_name(parameter1,parameter2){<br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp//Code to be executed<br/>}</p>
<h3>JavaScript Objects</h3><p>Objects represents one of the JavaScript Data types. We can can use it to store various complex entities like String, Integers, Arrays etc. . It stores data in (Key : Value) Pair. See objects.js file in repository to see Syntax and various methods of Objects.</p><br/>
Syntax:<br/>
let object_name ={<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp key:value,<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp name:'Your_Name'<br/>
}
